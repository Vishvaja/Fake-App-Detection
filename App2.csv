I remember trying this at a friends house years ago.Now Ive been using it for about 3-months and its the only one Ill buy.
WHERE HAS IT GONE???Hi Simple!This is my absolute must-have facial moisturiser and now I cannot find it in UK stores anywhere.Have you discontinued this product?! Please don't!
new formula makes me constantly sneezePlease go back to the old capsules - these new ones make our household suffer a terrible allergic reaction - constant hay fever!
All Day FreshCouldn't find any in shops so bought on-line. Thought it was fake branding because it smelled similar but not quite Africa. Poorer product since the new labelling!
Will certainly last a while Great Value shampoo
