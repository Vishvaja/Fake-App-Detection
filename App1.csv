Excellent
Very handy,Does what is says it does
Excellent on my badly treated hair,Always use this product on my heavily mistreated hair and it works wonders time after time
Its not the one in the picture, but gets 5 stars because its the regular one I use and its awesome for people with dry skin.
I remember trying this at a friends house years ago. Now Ive been using it for about 3-months and its the only one Ill buy.
